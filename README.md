# Data-Analytics-Data-Science
Here I will publish my projects in the field of Data Analytics and Data Science.
At the moment, there are:
  1. Research project (files: Research project.ipynb)
In this research project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of a dataset, which included data cleaning, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) by examining the distribution of features, identifying correlations between variables, and visualizing key patterns. The goal of this project was to uncover insights and patterns within the data through detailed statistical analysis and visualizations.

  2. Mini statistics project (files: Statistics_project.ipynb, youtube_2025_dataset for statistics project.csv)
This project focused on the statistical analysis of a dataset, where I performed a basic exploration of feature distributions and examined key statistical properties of the data. Through various plots and visualizations, I assessed the underlying distribution of specific variables, and analyzed the relationship between features. The analysis also provided insights into the dataâ€™s overall trends and characteristics, contributing to a better understanding of its structure.
  
  3. A/B-testing with using t-tests (files: A_B_testing_with_t_test.ipynb, Partially Cleaned Salary Dataset.csv)
In this project, I conducted several A/B tests to compare the salaries between two companies and between two different locations using t-tests. The analysis involved checking for statistically significant differences in salary data across the two groups. I performed hypothesis testing, calculated p-values, and visualized the results to assess if the observed differences were meaningful, helping to determine whether salary disparities exist between the groups.

  4. Analysis of A/B-test results for key metrics (files: Analysis_of_A_B_Test_Results_for_Key_Metrics.ipynb, control_group.csv, test_group.csv)
This project involved conducting A/B tests on product-related metrics such as conversion rate, click-through rate (CTR), cost per acquisition (CPA), and add-to-cart rate. I analyzed the results from test and control groups, comparing these metrics to see if there were any statistically significant differences. The analysis revealed some significant differences in certain metrics, which provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of product-related strategies.
